# TransferLearning-FTF

research-driven framework for applying transfer learning techniques to Flame transfer function. It enables fast adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains by leveraging intermediate feature representations.

Supporting python code and training data for the preprint of the article "Predicting the Flame Transfer Function using few-shot learning". The article was submitted to the journal Data-Centric Engineering of the Cambridge University Press.
